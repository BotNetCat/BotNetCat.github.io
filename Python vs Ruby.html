    <h1 class="Headers">Python or Ruby,What programing language is better for exploiting?</h1><br>
      <p>In the first view Python is more trended than Ruby these days but we review
       Python and Ruby advantges both
       and at the end we see which one is better for penetration testing.
       Ruby and Python are high-level programming languages
       because they follow a syntax similar to the English Language. 
   	   Therefore, these languages are easily understandable by the programmer.
   	   Ruby and Python both are interpreted languages. Both languages have a large community support.
   	   One major advantage of Ruby and Python is that these languages support object-oriented programming (OOP).</p><br>
   	   <P>Dont feel dizzy to make a long story short:</P>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High human readability.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Strong libraries.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Larg numbers of developers.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong></li>
      </ul>

			<P>We saw both languages overview but what's the exact definition of Ruby and Python!.</p>
			<h2 class="Headers">What is Ruby?</h2>	
			<P>Ruby is a high-level programming language designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It runs on various platforms such as Windows, Mac etc.  Ruby has features similar to Small Talk, Python and Perl. The main purpose of creating Ruby was to make the language powerful than Perl and more object-oriented than Python. Ruby supports object-oriented programming. Therefore, it is easier for the developers to model and build complex software. The program can modify its own structure and behaviour at runtime. Therefore, it is reflective.
			Ruby syntax is easy to learn and read. There is not much complex syntax, naming and behaviour. Ruby syntax is similar to English language and easily understandable by the programmer, so it is categorized as a high-level programming language.  The programmer understandable ruby program is converted into a machine-readable format using an interpreter. Therefore, Ruby is an interpreted language. Ruby is a not a fast as a compiled language C or C++.
   	 		Methods in Ruby are similar to functions in other programming languages.
     		A method contains a set of statements to be executed to perform a certain task. Ruby defines closures using blocks. Closures have read and write access to variables from the outer scope. Ruby has data types such as arrays, hashes.Ruby on Rails is a web framework written in Ruby for web development.  It is easily embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Ruby can also be used to build multi-threaded applications that are to run multiple threads simultaneously. Overall Ruby is useful for web development, network programming and for creating Graphical User Interfaces.</P>

     		<h2 class="Headers">What is Python?</h2>
    		<p>Python is a high-level general purpose programming language. It was designed by Guido van Rossum. Python is considered as one of the popular languages among beginners because it is easy to read, learn and maintain. Python is also useful even for complex applications. There is large community support for Python. It is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that is used to model a program or system using objects.  Python is reflective because the program can change the structure at runtime. It also supports functional programming that is to build the program or the software using functions avoiding mutable data and shared state.

     		Python is an interpreter-based language. Unlike in compiler-based languages that use a compiler to convert the source code in to object code, Python uses an interpreter. It runs Python statement after statement. Therefore, Python is a slow language.  However, Python is an interactive language. The programmer can install Python and use the command line to run Python instructions. There are also sophisticated Integrated Development Environments used to Python developments. These IDEs contain code editors and perform automatic code completion. Those IDEs also arranges all the related files necessary for the project. Some IDEs for Python are PyCharm and Eclipse.
     		python supports data types such as Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples. In Python, can define a function inside another function. The inner function has read access to variables from the outer function. Outer functions do not have write access.
     		Python is useful for developing Graphical User Interfaces. It is also easy to connect Python with databases such as MySQL, Oracle. Python is a language that can be used for multiple applications. It is used for web development, embedded systems, scientific computing, multithreaded applications and many more. Now it is also popular for developing algorithms for natural language processing, computer vision and machine learning.</p>

	<h2 class="Headers">Summary</h2>
	<P>Ruby and Python are easy to learn and use languages. These languages are quite popular in the community. They are high-level programming languages. Both are multi-paradigm languages. Both support object-oriented programming. The difference between Ruby and Python is that Ruby is mostly usied for web development while Python is mostly used for a variety of applications including web development.</P><br>
	<h2 class="Headers">Result</h2>
    <p>I think both languages are good in penetration testing but in exploiting in my oponion Ruby is better <br>
    because <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a>( an exploiting frame work) built in Ruby language and this is a big advantge for Ruby.
    Metasploit is the worldâ€™s most used penetration testing framework.You can use it on <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali-linux</a> and enjoy it.</p><br>
    <p>I hope it was a helpful article.</p>
